# Lemon Chat

> A slack clone app built by using React and Google Firebase

## Why this app?
This is a chat app that I built for fun, just to sharpen my React with Redux skills and practice how to use Google Firebase. I have never used a cloud-based database before, and This time I chose Google Firebase because it has a lot of built-in real-time interaction supports. Since this is eventually an online chat app, I want to make the websocket and real-time stuffs easy, and therefore I chose Firebase. 

Firebase also allows me to focus on the frontend of the application intead of worrying about the backend too much. In fact, this project is primarily a frontend-only application. 

## Usage
To start the application on your local machine, clone the project and run:

```
$ npm start
```
This will start a local version of the app in your `localhost:3000` port. Or, you can visit https://lemon-chat1.herokuapp.com/ for a quick demonstration of how the app works. You are welcomed to send any messages there!
